# Rocket_to_the_Moon
Calculate the positions of a rocket travelling between the Earth and Moon using the Runge-Kutta method for solving differential equations of motion.
Trajectories are defined in list format.
The first list item is a string defining the starting location of the rocket. Current options are:
'L1' - Langrangian Point 1 
'L2' - Langrangian Point 2
'Earth_Orbit' - Orbit above the Earth
The second list item is a list defining time array index values at which to apply a boost.
The third list item is a list defining boost magnitudes.
